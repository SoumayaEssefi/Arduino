# Arduino Projects

Welcome to my **Arduino Projects** repository! Here, you will find a collection of exciting projects that demonstrate the capabilities of Arduino through practical electronics concepts. Each project includes its source code and detailed explanations to enhance your understanding of how it works.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Arduino, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Download the Arduino IDE**: You can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. **Install Necessary Libraries**: Some projects may require additional libraries, which are specified in the project descriptions.

## Projects Overview

Below is a list of the Arduino projects included in this repository:

| Project                        | Description                                                          | Difficulty  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **LED_PWM**                   | Controls the brightness of an LED using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). | Beginner    |
| **Control_LED_with_Button**   | Toggles an LED on or off using a button; the LED turns off when the button is pressed. | Beginner    |
| **Traffic_Light_Simulation**  | Simulates a traffic light using three LEDs (red, orange, green).     | Beginner    |
| **Reaction_Game**             | A fun game where a buzzer sounds at random intervals, and the player must press a button to stop the timer. | Intermediate |
| **LCD_Display**               | Displays custom text on a 16x2 LCD screen. | Beginner    |

## Requirements

To run these projects, you will need:

- An Arduino board (Uno, Nano, or any compatible model)
